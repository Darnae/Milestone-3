# Milestone-3
Inventory Manager 


For this Milestone, I had to make another Inventory class. I needed create five different methods; one to add an item, one to remove an item, one to restock an item, one to search for an item, and finally one to display all of the items within the inventory. 

I created a UML diagram that maps out the design of my class. Along with my screencast (the walkthrough of my program in action), I have attached a transcript (in a text file) that describes what is shown in my screencast. 

At the beginning of the course, I had informed you that my audio would not work properly for screencast videos as they have not for other classes. You told me to add this in the readme of each project that needed a screencast, and that it was ok to have a transcript.
